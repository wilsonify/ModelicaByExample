This chapter provided a brief overview of important concepts and language constructs in Modelica. However, for a more complete understanding of the language, readers should refer to Chapters 3-11 and 13. The chapter introduced concepts such as object-oriented mathematical modeling and acausal physical modeling, and discussed the language constructs for defining components, connections, and connectors. It also included an example of translating and executing a simple model, and a brief history of equations and mathematical modeling languages, culminating in the development of Modelica.
