In this chapter, the basic building blocks of Modelica are introduced, starting with characters and lexical units, which are combined to form tokens, such as literals, identifiers, and operators. These tokens are detected by the lexical analysis part of the Modelica translator. Expressions, which are larger building blocks formed from lexical units according to the rules given by the expression part of the Modelica grammar, are then described in detail. This chapter covers the evaluation rules for expressions, type conversions, expression variability, built-in mathematical operators and functions, and the set of built-in special Modelica operators with function syntax. While array expressions are covered in more detail in Chapter 7 and name lookup is described in Chapter 3, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the basic building blocks of Modelica.
