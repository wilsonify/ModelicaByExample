This provides an overview of some important concepts in modeling and simulation. It explains that systems can be represented by models, which can then be simulated through experiments. Some models are mathematical, depending on the properties of the system being modeled and the approximations made in the model. There are different classes of mathematical models, including static versus dynamic models, and continuous-time versus discrete-time models. This book focuses on object-oriented, component-based technology for building and simulating mathematical models.
