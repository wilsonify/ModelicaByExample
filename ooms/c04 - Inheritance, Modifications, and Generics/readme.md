Inheritance in Modelica allows developers to create a new class (the derived class or subclass) by inheriting properties and behavior from an existing class (the base class or superclass). This allows for code reuse and simplifies the process of building complex models.

When a subclass is created, it can add or modify properties and behavior of the base class. This is done through modification and redeclaration, which allows developers to make changes to inherited elements without changing the base class.

Modelica also supports multiple inheritance, which allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from multiple base classes. This can be particularly useful when creating complex models that require a combination of different features and behaviors.

Generic classes in Modelica provide an additional level of flexibility by allowing developers to define classes with type parameters, which can be used to create different instances of the class with different types of inputs and outputs.

Overall, inheritance is a powerful feature in Modelica that allows developers to build complex models by reusing and modifying existing classes.
