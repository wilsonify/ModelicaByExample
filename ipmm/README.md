# Examples from "Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica"

![Logo](https://rawgithub.com/xogeny/FirstBookExamples/master/FirstBookExamples/Resources/Images/animated-logo.gif)

In this directory, you will find the examples from my first book on
Modelica, "Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica".  These are
the models that originally accompanied the book on CD.  At some point,
Kluwer/Springer decided (probably as a cost saving measure) to stop
distributing the CD with the book.  Having been asked over the years
for the source code, I've decided to put it up on GitHub.  Ironically,
I myself had lost track of the source code but fortunately, @dietmarw
had a copy handy.

## Important Caveats

  * These examples are from my **first** book on Modelica.  If you want
    the examples from my more recent book [Modelica by Example](http://book.xogeny.com),
    you should look in [this GitHub repository instead](https://github.com/xogeny/ModelicaBook)

  * ~~These examples are **old** and probably won't run with modern Modelica
    compilers.  Although the Modelica Association has tried to maintain
    backward compatibility over the years, I suspect many of them simply
    will not work.  But I've included so that people can at least learn
    from the models.~~ *(updated to Modelica 3.x in late 2016)*

  * These models are really **unvalidated**.  Please don't use the models
    for any kind of "production" use without independently validating the
    results they give.  I didn't have the resources to validate them
    when I wrote the book.  Most of the simple models are probably fine,
    but I suspect more complicated examples like the combustion models
    probably have errors.

  * Any scripts you find (`.mos` files) were original written for a very old version
    of Dymola. ~~If they work at all (which seems unlikely to me), they will
    only work with Dymola.~~
    *(The scripts have been updated and tested with Dymola 2017.)*
    Thankfully, the scripts aren't very important.

  * I can only release the models.  As much as I would love to release the
    text of the book, I cannot because I do not have the rights for that.
    I was only able to retain the copyrights to the examples.

  * I am releasing this under an MIT open source license so that people
    are basically free to do what they want with this material.

  * I **will** accept pull requests from anybody who finds errors in these
    examples.
