In Modelica, the interface of a subsystem is defined by its public connectors. Connectors are like ports through which a subsystem interacts with other subsystems or the environment. The connectors define the input and output signals of the subsystem.

The signals that flow through a connector have a type, which describes the kind of value that is transmitted. For example, a signal might be a real number, a vector, or a structure.

Connectors can also have modifiers that specify their behavior. For example, a flow modifier indicates that a connector represents a flow of energy or mass. Another modifier is the parameter modifier, which indicates that a connector represents a parameter that can be set from the outside.

Subsystems can have input, output, or bidirectional connectors. A bidirectional connector can both receive and send signals.

When a subsystem is used in a larger model, its public connectors can be connected to the connectors of other subsystems or to inputs and outputs of the top-level model. This is how subsystems can be composed to build complex models.

By defining a clear and consistent interface for a subsystem, it can be used and reused in different models without modification, making it easier to build and maintain complex systems.

a subsystem model is a collection of components and other subsystems connected together to create a larger, more complex model. The parameters and connectors of the subsystem are public and are used to interact with the subsystem from the outside. The implementation details of the subsystem are typically hidden and marked as protected to prevent accidental modification and to make the model easier to understand and use.
