based on Modelica by Example
by Michael M. Tiller

Modelica is a high-level, object-oriented, declarative language used to describe the behavior of complex engineering systems. It is designed for modeling and simulation of physical systems, such as mechanical, electrical, thermal, and hydraulic systems, among others.

In Modelica, engineers can describe the behavior of different types of engineering components, such as springs, resistors, clutches, and so on, using equations that describe their physical properties and behaviors. These components can then be combined into subsystems, systems or even architectures, to model more complex systems.

One of the advantages of Modelica is that it allows engineers to model multi-domain systems, meaning systems that involve multiple physical domains or disciplines. For example, a Modelica model could include both mechanical and electrical components, such as a motor driving a mechanical load. This ability to model multi-domain systems makes Modelica a very powerful tool for engineering design and analysis.

Overall, Modelica is a versatile and powerful tool for modeling and simulating complex engineering systems, and is widely used in industry and academia for a variety of applications, from designing aircraft engines to optimizing building energy consumption.

One of the key advantages of Modelica is its technical capability, which is made possible by the use of complex algorithms and advanced simulation techniques behind the scenes. This allows engineers to focus on high-level mathematical descriptions of component behavior, without needing to have a deep understanding of complex topics like differential-algebraic equations, symbolic manipulation, numeric solvers, code generation, and post-processing.

Another key advantage of Modelica is its support for a wide range of modeling formalisms, which allows engineers to describe both continuous and discrete behavior using a hybrid differential-algebraic equation framework. This makes it possible to model a wide range of engineering systems and phenomena, including systems with complex interactions between different physical domains.

In addition, Modelica supports both causal and acausal modeling approaches within the same model. This flexibility allows engineers to choose the modeling approach that best suits their needs and the requirements of the system they are designing or analyzing.

Overall, the technical capability of Modelica is a key reason why it is widely used in industry and academia for a variety of engineering design and analysis applications. Its support for advanced simulation techniques and a wide range of modeling formalisms make it a powerful tool for engineers working on complex engineering systems.
