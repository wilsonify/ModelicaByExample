In addition to the syntactic constructs for building arrays in Modelica, there are also many array construction c04Functions that can be used to build and manipulate arrays. These c04Functions can be useful for creating arrays with specific properties or for performing operations on arrays.

Some common array construction c04Functions in Modelica include:

* fill: 

creates an array filled with a specified value

* linspace: 

creates a vector of evenly spaced values between two endpoints
    
* logspace: 

creates a vector of logarithmically spaced values between two endpoints

* diag: 

creates a diagonal matrix from a vector

*  reshape: 

reshapes an array into a new size and shape

* transpose: 

transposes a matrix or vector

* cat: 

concatenates arrays along a specified dimension

These c04Functions can be very useful for creating and manipulating arrays in a concise and efficient way. By using these c04Functions, engineers can build complex arrays with specific properties that are needed for their modeling and simulation tasks.
